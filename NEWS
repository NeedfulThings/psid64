psid64-0.3 (Sun Nov 11 11:27:02 CET 2001):

* Fixed a classic bug in release 0.2. On Windows machines without Cygwin
  installed, all files are treated as text files by default. This results in
  corrupt program files where a carriage return character is inserted before
  each new line character.

psid64-0.2 (Sat Nov 10 13:15:45 CET 2001):

* Ported to Windows/Cygwin platform.
* Supports screens located in the memory ranges $4000-$8000 and $c000-$d000.
* Supports long option formats on systems with getopt_long().
* Possible to specify multiple PSID files to be converted on the command line.


psid64-0.1 (Sat Sep  8 13:10:56 CEST 2001):

* Initial release.
